## Quick Reference:
To begin with, the proposed framework,Deep Closing, consists of two operation:
- (1) Deep Dilation: https://github.com/5k5000/DeepClosing/blob/c7c5ce9d3173ae1449f739da1dfc38aac61c4074/DeepClosing.py#L289
- (2) Simple Component Erosion:
https://github.com/5k5000/DeepClosing/blob/2e7cb06a8948dea991485ff989017f9bb5b03977/DeepClosing.py#L259
- (*) DeepClosing = DeepDilation + Simple Component Erosion (Inference):
